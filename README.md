#### Summary
Operating Platforms final project: Software Design Document

#### Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
Currently, Draw it or Lose it, a game by The Gaming Room, is available only on Android. The goal is to develop a web-based version of the game that could be executed on multiple platforms. The game will have one or more teams per game and each team can have multiple players on them. Only one instance of the game can exist in memory at a time, so each game, team and player will need to have a unique identifier, and players will be able to check if chosen game or team names are already in use.  

#### What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I believe I excelled at completing the nessesary research to provide clear and consise direction to the Gaming Room so they could make informed decisions on how best to proceed with the project. This first step can be the differnce between a successful execution and a great execution.

#### What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The biggest advantage to working through a design document was my ability to step outside of my comfort zone. It forces you to truly dig for the best solutions for the development project in question. It is easy to execute to what you know, but taking the time to find the right way to move forward rather than the way you know can help you make informed decisions when developing the code.

#### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
The one area that I beleive could utilize the most revision would be the recommendations section. I believe it is very detailed and informative, but I don't believe that I have the detailed knowledge at this time that I could have. I would like to take additional time to fully understand the capabilities that are available in the industry to make a better and more informed recommendation in the different sections.

#### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
In the end, the design is the clients, and you are working to solve their needs, not your own. If the end product doesn't meet the clients needs, then you have not completed the design as intended. When working on this project, I took the initial client needs and then broke them down into their individual components throughout the software design document, which in turn, ensured that the end product was what the client needed.

#### How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I would spend time researching existing platforms or software that may be in the market to understand current best practices and how best to move forward when designing the project I am working on. Doing extensive research prior to completing the software design document and the first line of code ensures that you have a gameplan in place. This helps reduce the amount of rework or change in direction as you are working through the development process.
